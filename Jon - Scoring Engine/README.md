This Scoring Engine is from https://github.com/scoringengine/scoringengine and updated/modified/configured for my needs, servers/services, users and passwords, etc.

Follow the instructions from https://github.com/scoringengine/scoringengine to know how to start/build the Scoring Engine.

This is for when starting the competition for the first time.  Requires updating the password on the website UI during competition, but will need you to update the users with the latest passwords (the Blue teams' passwords every time they change it) for each service directly in /bin/competition.yaml file if you shut down the scoring engine at the end of each day of competition.  Note that updating the passwords in the website UI does not directly save the passwords in the /bin/competition.yaml file.
